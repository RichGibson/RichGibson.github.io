## Talks/Conferences

- <u>State of the Map US 2013: Street Name Fight</u> Rich Gibson and Sophia Parafina. 

- <u>BodyTrack: Open Source Tools for Health Empowerment through Self-Tracking</u>, Anne Wright, Candide Kemmler, and Rich Gibson, O'Reilly Open Source Conference, 2012. [slides](https://www.slideshare.net/OReillyOSCON/bodytrack-open-source-tools-for-health-empowerment-through-selftracking) Section 'The Eyes Have it: using photos for Self Tracking', starting on slide 17

- <u>Explorable Microscopy</u>, with Anne Wright, O'Reilly Open Source Converence, 2012. [Interview from
  the conference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUmxNGfXP7U)

- <u>Mapping the Wireless Revolution</u>, with Schuyler Earle, O'Reilly Emerging Technology Conference, 2003  

  In this talk Schuyler and I remarked that many of the tecnnological themes 'emerging' have a 20-year history:
  much of the new work is a rediscovery and recovery of past ideas and ideals.

  Updating this <i>about md</i> file in (checks date) 2023 it seems that perhaps I should be reviewing my
  old notes :-). But no, seriously...
