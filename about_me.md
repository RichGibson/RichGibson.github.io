# About me - we all contain multitudes

It is interesting to see how we describes ourselves, or are described by others, in such
a simple format as the conference or publication 'about the author/speaker' blurb.

Here are some ways I've self described, or been described by others. I imagine
that I will add to this.

Rich Gibson, Gigapanner, Gigapan.org

Rich Gibson works on the Gigapan and Explorable Microscopy Projects for Carnegie Melon University and NASA's Intelligent Robotics Group, and independently creating high resolution portraits of people and developing new ways to archive physical spaces with explorable images.

He is a bricoleur hacker, artist, programmer, author, and builder.

He helped create the Neogeography movement, coauthoring Mapping Hacks and Google Maps Hacks. The process of working with and exploring how we interact and explore space lead him to the more generalized world of providing both context, and detail with explorable images.

For the past four years he has been obsessed with creating new ways to capture and use high resolution images of everything, including the Chaos Communications Camp in 2007, Volcanos in Arizona for NASA, the incredibly tidy offices of Monochrom in Vienna, details of cell metosis in mouse testis with sub-micron resolution, and portraits of people with the details of landscapes.

Rich Gibson is a Perl/Database programmer in Santa Rosa. He has worked professionally with computers since 1982 when he created Public Utility Rate Case Models in SuperCalc on an Osborne II. While the technology has changed, his fascination with using finger muscle power to control electrical impulses has not.

His current fascination is creating tools to aid in the acquistion, management, and presentation of information with a geographic component. He is currently converting an old golf cart into a mobile geo annoation platform.

He is active with the NoCat Community Network in Sebastopol, California. In his free time he dives for Abalone and Halibut and tries to keep up with his wife and three explosively active kids.
