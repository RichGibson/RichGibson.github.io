# A long day, and I am open for business

My professional life has enabled me to pivot, but to what, exactly is as yet unsure.

After so long doing most of my work behind a (porous) wall of proprietary things, I have lost the habit of openness.

My todo file, based on my beliefs, says to replicate [Simon Willison's work patterns](https://simonwillison.net/). Which means a blog, and regular Things I Learned (TIL), and git, and documentation first work on projects.

And so here is the blog.

I am looking for work now. I am a spatially enabled software engineer. Or a poke around and discover patters sort of data scientist. 

I am good with Python and Pandas and QGIS and PostGIS, and GDAL tools and ETL for all the data things. Experienced with various commercial (LightBox, Precisely, Ookla) and open (ACS, FCC 477, FCC BDC) data sources.

I coauthored two books. <href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/mapping-hacks/0596007035/">Mapping Hacks</a> (2005) and <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/google-maps-hacks/0596101619/">Google Maps Hacks</a> (2006). 

But today was a long day unrelated to all of that. Needed to drive an hour and a half each way to go to urgent care for my sweetie.

And then a start at trying to mimic or mirror Simon's work habits.
