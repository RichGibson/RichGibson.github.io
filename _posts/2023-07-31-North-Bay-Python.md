# North Bay Python 2023

The [2023 North Bay Python](https://2023.northbaypython.org/) conference just
wrapped up.

I gained so much from the conference, and I feel a renewed excitement about
programming and engaging in interesting projects.

Every talk was interesting, Several were directly relevant to
where I think that I am, and one talk was just mind blowing. 

There were cats, and that was surprisingly nice. One came up and jumped
in my lap, unprompted, during the introduction. So I felt like I was the
chosen one.

But it was a cat, so it let me know fairly quickly that I should not practice
the hubris of feeling special!

An introduction to Python Enhancement Proposals (PEPs), the PEP process, and ways to
get involved with the PEP process.

Their first slide was titled 'PEP 8: Style Guide for Python Code' and I remembered,
and made note of the fact that one can read PEPs and become less ignorant.

There was an overview of PEP's and then a discussion of The PEP Lifecycle. The slide
was 

'Start with a<del>n idea</del> for Python.'

And then 'idea' became 'problem.' An idea is amorphous, while a problem is 
subject to a solution. So a later slide then had the word problem replaced with 'solution.'

That was as good reminder for me, when given a choice I can stay in the world of 
ideas for a bit longer than is strictly helpful.

## [I Take Exception to Your Exceptions: Using Custom Errors to Get Your Point Across ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJ5EO7tnDiQ) 
Joe Kaufield

There was a lot of hands on directly useful content here, I felt grounded by the number
of useful code samples that Joe showed. 

A main point of Joe's was that a custom exception is a contextual error about what the user 
is trying to do, and it is up to us as developers to provide that contextual information, and
he tied it to the second guiding principle of the Zen of Python: Explicit is better than implicit.

## [Teaching with Jupyter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QJuOZXb_AY)
Moshe Zadka 

And he started off in what seemed like a bit of an abstract way. Talking about teaching, 
and that that  "we live in a very different world than even a few years ago. You want to 
think from the beginning of the hybrid world."

Which means in person, remote, and self paced. And he talked, and had some examples, of 
sharing text with contents and formatting, and graphics, and interactivity. And then 
the interactivity slide expanded to examples of interactivity and I thought to my self
'self, Moshe just lead us step by step to why we would want to use Jupyter for teaching.'

It was a fun realization, that Moshe had rather cleanly created a narrative arc which
lead inexorably to Jupyter. 

Since I already like Jupyter it was fun to be lead again to a reason why Jupyter is often the answer.

Moshe covered some basic advantages of Jupyter, like that a notebook can be a sharable  artifact of an 
exploration into code or data.

    - Make Mistakes
    - Learn
    - Share
    - Do better

The main limitation he covered was 'Server set-up non-trivial.'

I feel like developers often use the phrase 'non-trivial' amongst ourselves, 
but often when I say 'non-trivial' in a non-technical context the expression
draws attention. 

And when he showed the '
